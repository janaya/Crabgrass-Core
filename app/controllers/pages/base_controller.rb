  ## CONSTRUCTOR
  ##

  # if the page controller is call by our custom DispatchController,
  # objects which have already been loaded will be passed to the tool
  # via this initialize method.
  def initialize(seed={})
    super()
    @user  = seed[:user]   # the user context, if any
    @group = seed[:group]  # the group context, if any
    @page  = seed[:page]   # the page object, if already fetched
  end

  ## ACTIONS
  ##

  def show
  end

  def edit
  end

  def update
  end

  protected

  # to be overridden by subclasses
  def fetch_data; end
  def setup_options; end

  ##
  ## PAGE OPTIONS
  ## subclasses can control how a page is displayed by changing these values.
  ## they should do so by defining setup_options() and modifying @options member
  ## variable (which is of type Pages::BaseController::Options)
  ##

  class Options
    attr_accessor :show_posts     # show comments for this page?
    attr_accessor :show_reply     # show form to post new comment?
    attr_accessor :show_assets    # show assets for this page?
    attr_accessor :show_tags      # show tags for this page?
    attr_accessor :show_sidebar   # show the page sidebar?
    attr_accessor :show_tabs      # load 'tabs' partial?
    attr_accessor :title          # html title
  end

  ##
  ## CONTEXT
  ##

  def setup_context
    if @page and @page.owner
      if @page.owner == current_user
        @context = Context::Me.new(current_user)
      else

  # 'destroy' should be reserved for when the action has consequence,
  # like destroying a group.
  #
  # 'delete' should be used otherwise, like deleting a request.
  #
  # 'remove' is different. You remove a user from a group, or a user from your contacts.
  #
  # alternately, maybe 'destroy' should be for actions that cannot be undone.
